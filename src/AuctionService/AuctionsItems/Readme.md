The Auction Service is part of an auction system responsible for managing auctions. It provides functionality for creating, updating, and deleting auctions, as well as retrieving information about existing auctions. This service is a crucial component in the system, ensuring reliable and efficient management of auctions and their states.

## Key Functions of the Service:
- Creating auctions with options to specify reserve price, end time, and other attributes.
- Updating auction details such as reserve price, end date, and other parameters.
- Deleting auctions if they have no bids and haven't met the reserve price.
- Retrieving information about specific auctions based on their identifiers.
- Retrieving lists of all auctions or auctions updated after a specific date.

The service also interacts with other components through events such as auction creation, update, and deletion. It consumes events from other services, such as bid placements and auction end notifications, to keep auction statuses up to date.
